# Odds-and-Evens

This solidity contract faciliates a game of odds and evens but also especially with a function(claim or refund) that is described here: http://people.csail.mit.edu/ranjit/papers/poker.pdf

The first player to "choose" or enter a bet has until the other player "chooses" to refund player one's initial deposit.  Once player two "chooses" each player MUST "reveal" their choices in the reveal round, in order to have a chance at getting their deposit back (and to win the other players deposit).  If a player enters a choice, they automatically lose their deposit to the other player, if they don't later reveal their encrypted chocie. In a situation where one player doesn't reveal, the player that DOES reveal has claim to both deposits.

The purpose of the claim or refund primitive is such that each player decides to enter a bet without having to reveal their choice.  Only when BOTH players have deposited and made their choice are they asked to reveal. 

The two important features are:

1) There is no fear of playing versus another player that hasn't deposited.

2) No malicious player can profit, by forcing an honest player to reveal their choice, while not revealing their own.
